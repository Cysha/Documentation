# Configuration

- [Admin Panel](#admin)

<a name="admin"></a>
## <a href="#admin">#</a> Admin Panel

Once installed the system has an Administrative Panel, you can customize most of the system with these settings.
The system will save the settings into a database table `config`. Anything saved into this table can override core Laravel and Module settings alike.
